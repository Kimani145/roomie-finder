# 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Tailwind CSS Not Configured

## What Was Wrong

Your app was showing **unstyled text on black background** because Tailwind CSS wasn't configured!

## What I Just Fixed

✅ Created `tailwind.config.js`
✅ Created `postcss.config.js`
✅ Updated `src/styles/global.css` with `@tailwind` directives
✅ Added Tailwind dependencies to `package.json`

## Run These Commands NOW

```bash
cd C:\Users\kimny\Documents\projects\roomie-finder

# Install Tailwind CSS
npm install

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## What You'll See After Fix

✅ **White cards** with borders and shadows
✅ **Profile photos** (or initials in colored circles)
✅ **Emerald compatibility badges** at bottom-right of photos
✅ **Budget pills** at bottom-left of photos
✅ **Slate-50 logistics block** with Move-in + Budget
✅ **Proper spacing, colors, and typography**
